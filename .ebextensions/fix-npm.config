# This file is controlled by the `eb-fix-npm` Node module. If you'd like to
# modify it, you either should publish a new version of that module and update
# to that version; or, you should uninstall that module and then edit this file
# --uninstallation won't take the file with it.

# This file contains fixes for npm. Node is installed using a hook called
# "40install_node.sh" and `npm install` is run using a hook called "50npm.sh",
# so npm setup should be done in hooks beginning with "4x" (x > 0)
# and cleanup should be done in hooks beginning with "5x" (x > 0).
